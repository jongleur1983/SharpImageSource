# SharpImageSource
an Wpf Image Source for ImageSharp Images.

Early experients, yet, but contains a working demo.

In https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/issues/531 @wexman asked if there's a way to use an ImageSharp Image in a WPF image control.
This project contains a first BitmapSource derived class that can be backed by an ImageSharp Image.
